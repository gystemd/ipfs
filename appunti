TODO: investigate how to use boxo index to find the pin


Index from Boxo, but what Do I have to index actually?
the pin names


I checked what we did in remote pinning years ago, and it uses --name for filtering:

$ ipfs pin remote ls --help
[..]
--name     string - Return pins with names that contain the value provided (case-sensitive, exact match)

opts = append(opts, pinclient.PinOpts.FilterName(nameStr))

if len(settings.name) > 0 {
    getter = getter.Name(settings.name)
}
